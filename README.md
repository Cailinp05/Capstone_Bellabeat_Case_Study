# 3. Prepare 
:bar_chart: 3.1 Dataset used
The specific dataset used is a public dataset from Kaggle which contains a personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal
tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information
about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. 

:lock: 3.2 Data Accessibility and Privacy
The dataset is public and can be easily accessed via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit. The owner published this dataset in order for anyone to download and use and was inspired by human temporal routine behavioral analysis and pattern recognition. By copyright law, one can copy, edit, and share using this dataset with no permission needed. 

:information_source: 3.3 Dataset Information

The content of this dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents the use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors/preferences.

:white_check_mark: 3.4 Data Verification/Data Integrity 

This dataset zip file is a combination of 18 CSV files. Each file represents quantitative data by the smart device. The data is long and wide as each row is a one-time point per subject (each subject will have multiple rows). Every user has a unique ID and multiple rows of tracked data by day and time. 

Sorting, filtering, cleaning, and merging were required in order to observe and verify the attributes of each dataset. 

This data has a sample size of 30 users with no demographic information, therefore, a sampling bias was encountered. It is uncertain whether the sample size was representative of the whole population. The dataset is also limited to a survey of only 2 months long. 

The data is from 2016 and only includes April and May months. The data could be sample selection bias and not reflect the overall population. 

# 4. Process 
:hammer_and_wrench: 4.

I used R studio for verifying, cleaning, transformation, analysis and visualization. 

Importing libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

library(corrplot)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(av)

```

Importing datasets example:

```{r}
daily_activity <- read.csv("fitness/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_calories <- read.csv("fitness/dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_intensities <- read.csv("fitness/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read.csv("fitness/dailySteps_merged.csv")
heartrate <- read.csv("fitness/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
hourly_calories <- read.csv("fitness/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourly_intensities <- read.csv("fitness/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read.csv("fitness/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
minute_calories_narrow <- read.csv("fitness/minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv")
minute_calories_wide <- read.csv("fitness/minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv")
minute_intensities_narrow <- read.csv("fitness/minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv")
minute_intensities_wide <- read.csv("fitness/minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv")
minute_steps_narrow <- read.csv("fitness/minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv")
minute_steps_wide <- read.csv("fitness/minuteStepsWide_merged.csv")
minute_sleep <- read.csv("fitness/minuteSleep_merged.csv")
sleep <- read.csv("fitness/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read.csv("fitness/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
minute_met_narrow <- read.csv("fitness/minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
```
First I examined the data by checking for NA's, remove duplicates for the datasets. Here is one example:

```{r}
sum(duplicated(sleep))
sleep <- sleep %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()
sum(duplicated(sleep))
```
There are a few date format changes I had to do. Here is one example:

```{r}
sleep_tidy <- sleep %>% 
     mutate(Date = as.Date(sleep$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
   
   steps_tidy <- daily_steps %>% 
     mutate(Date = as.Date(daily_steps$ActivityDay, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
```

Some datasets were merged. Here is one of them:

```{r}
merged_steps_sleep <- merge(sleep_tidy, steps_tidy, by = "Date")
```
 

# 5 and 6. Analyze and Share
:mailbox_with_mail: and :bar_chart:

```{r}
ggplot(merged_steps_sleep, aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = StepTotal, color = Date)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Sleep Duration vs. Steps",
       x = "Total Minutes Asleep",
       y = "Total Steps") +
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```
![Sleep Duration vs. Steps](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Sleep%20Duration%20vs.%20Steps.png)


For some of the datasets I analyzed I added a new column based on the date in order to plot the days of the week on the x-axis. I used ggplot() to visualize the data and used custom colors chosen from http://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/#/hcl/1/0.92/000000/000000

Here is an example:

```{r}
# Define a custom color palette
custom_colors <- c("#D19CBA", "#9FAAD2", "#55B8CD", "#1AC0A7", "#5CBF6B", "#A2B52F", "#E59C1D")

# Order the weekdays in the desired order (Monday to Sunday)
daily_steps_aggregated$Weekday <- factor(daily_steps_aggregated$Weekday,
                                         levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

# Create the plot with custom colors
ggplot(daily_steps_aggregated, aes(x = Weekday, y = TotalSteps, fill = Weekday)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +  # Use custom colors
  labs(x = "Days of the week", y = "Total Steps", title = "Total Steps Taken Per Weekday with Custom Colors") +
  theme_minimal()
```
![Total Steps Taken Per Weekday with Custom Colors](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Total%20Steps%20Taken%20Per%20Weekday%20with%20Custom%20Colors.png)

Average Steps Analysis:
```{r}
ggplot(total_steps) + geom_line(aes(x=Ymd, y=Mean)) +
    labs(title="Average Steps By Day") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels= comma)
```
![Average Steps By Day](![Average Steps By Day](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Average%20Steps%20By%20Day.png)

From this we can see that majority of people are not walking the average daily steps of 10000. 

Average Distance Analysis:
```{r}
ggplot(total_distance) + geom_line(aes(x=Ymd, y=Mean)) +
     labs(title="Average Distance By Date", y= "Total Distance") + 
     scale_y_continuous(labels= comma)
```

![Average Distance By Date](![Average Distance By Date](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Average%20Distance%20By%20Date.png)

This is very similar to average steps with the same dip in the graph towards the end. 

I then merged the two datasets as below:

```{r}
   merged_steps_calories <- merge(daily_steps, daily_calories, by = "Ymd")
   
# Create a line plot for average daily steps and calories
   ggplot(merged_steps_calories, aes(x = Ymd)) +
     geom_line(aes(y = StepTotal, color = "Total Steps")) +
     geom_line(aes(y = Calories, color = "Calories"), linetype = "dashed") +
     labs(title = "Average Daily Steps and Calories",
          x = "Date",
          y = "Count") +
     scale_color_manual(values = c("Total Steps" = "blue", "Calories" = "red"))
```
![Average Daily Steps and Calories](![Average Daily Steps and Calories](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Average%20Daily%20Steps%20and%20Calories.png)

 As expected, the more steps people take, the more calories they burn.
 
Sleep vs Activity Analysis:

```{r}
str(daily_sleep)
str(daily_activity)

# Convert ActivityDate to a Date object
daily_activity$ActivityDate <- as.Date(daily_activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# Create separate columns for Day, Month, Year, Hour, and Date
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  mutate(Day = day(ActivityDate),
         Month = month(ActivityDate),
         Year = year(ActivityDate),
         Hour = hour(ActivityDate),
         Date = date(ActivityDate))

# Merge the two datasets based on common dates
daily_activity_sleep <- merge(daily_activity, daily_sleep, by = "Date")

# Time series plot of activity variables and sleep over time
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x = ActivityDate)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = TotalSteps, color = "Total Steps")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = VeryActiveMinutes, color = "Very Active Minutes")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = TotalMinutesAsleep, color = "Total Minutes Asleep")) +
  labs(title = "Trends in Daily Activity and Sleep",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Value") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Total Steps" = "blue", "Very Active Minutes" = "green", "Total Minutes Asleep" = "purple")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Stacked area plot of activity levels over time
ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = Date, y = LightlyActiveMinutes, fill = SedentaryMinutes)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Composition of Activity Levels Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Minutes") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Scatter plot with bubble size and color representing activity and sleep
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x = TotalSteps, y = VeryActiveMinutes, size = TotalSteps, color = TotalMinutesAsleep)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Steps, Activity, and Sleep",
       x = "Total Steps",
       y = "Very Active Minutes") +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 10)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![Sleep vs Activity Analysis](![Composition of Activity Levels Over Time](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Composition%20of%20Activity%20Levels%20Over%20Time.png)

From this we can see that people do not sleep enough hours and are not as active as they should be. Specifically, majority of people are lightly active, but more people are sedentary.  

Heartrate dataset:

```{r}
heartrate <- read.csv("fitness/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
str(heartrate)

# Extract Hour and Minutes using lubridate
heartrate$Hour <- hour(mdy_hms(heartrate$Time))
heartrate$Minutes <- minute(mdy_hms(heartrate$Time))
# Extract Month, Year, and Date using lubridate
heartrate$Month <- month(mdy_hms(heartrate$Time))
heartrate$Year <- year(mdy_hms(heartrate$Time))
heartrate$Day <- date(mdy_hms(heartrate$Time))

# Convert the "Day" column to a Date object
heartrate$Day <- as.Date(heartrate$Day)

# Create a new column "dayoftheweek" with the day of the week
heartrate$dayoftheweek <- weekdays(heartrate$Day)

# If you want to convert the day names to Monday-Sunday format, you can use this:
heartrate$dayoftheweek <- factor(heartrate$dayoftheweek, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

heart_rate <- heartrate %>%
  group_by(Day, Month, Year) %>%
  summarise(mean_heart_rate = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE))

heart_rate

#heartrate$MonthYear <- floor_date(heartrate$Day, unit = "month") 
#heartrate$MonthYear <- format(heartrate$Day, "%Y-%m")

heart_rate$Month <- factor(heart_rate$Month, levels = c(4, 5), labels = c("April", "May"))

# Create the plot
#ggplot(heart_rate, aes(x = MonthYear, y = mean_heart_rate, color = Month)) +
#  geom_line() +
#  labs(x = "Month/Year", y = "Heart Rate", title = "Daily Mean Heart Rate") +
 # scale_color_manual(values = c("4" = "pink", "5" = "blue"))
# Extract the month and year from the 'Day' column
# heartrate$MonthYear <- format(heartrate$Day, "%Y-%m")
#heartrate <- heartrate %>%
#  mutate(MonthYear = format(Day, "%Y-%m"))

# Create the plot
p1 <- ggplot(heart_rate, aes(x = Day, y = mean_heart_rate, color = Month)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month/Year", y = "heart_rate", title = "Daily Mean Heartrate") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("April" = "red", "May" = "blue"))

p1
```
![Daily Mean Heart Rate](![Daily Mean Heart Rate](https://github.com/Cailinp05/Capstone_Bellabeat_Case_Study/blob/main/Daily%20Mean%20Heartrate.png)

This shows the heartrate for both months. Due to heartrate dataset, I wanted to animate it for fun as such:

```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(av)
library(transformr)
#animating the above plot
plot1 <- p1+transition_reveal(as.numeric(Day))

animate(plot1)
```

Daily Steps Analysis for days of the week with custom colors:

```{r}
daily_steps <- read.csv("fitness/dailySteps_merged.csv")

str(daily_steps)

# Extract Month, Year, and Date using lubridate
# Assuming daily_steps is your data frame

# 7. Act
:muscle: 7. 

From the findings above I provide the following suggestions:
- Steps reminder notifications: As the majority of people using the devices do not reach the average 10000 steps. A reminder can be sent with a vibration to the device to remind people during the peak hours of the day to walk, exercise and burn more calories. 
- Workout Reminders: These can be sent to remind people to workout in their time during the day, either morning, during lunch, or after working hours. 
- A reward system: People can receive medals, or discounts if they reach a certain number of workouts, hours, or calories burnt in a month or their daily goals. Incentives are a great way to keep people active, allowing people to gain premium memberships or discounts on the latest devices. 
- Many people forget to track their sleep, steps, and calories burnt. A reminder to monitor these can also be sent with a reward system giving the people a breakdown of their sleeping patterns (Deep sleep, Light sleep, naps, and REM's) if they sleep 8 hours everyday. 
- The device can monitor these regardless but one can also incorporate the battery having to be charged and add a reminder everytime the battery gets charged to manually log sleep or activities once the device wakes up. 
- The app can send workout suggestions and incorporate the days of activeness to send the reminder at the appropriate times for individual users. 
- Since most people are more active on weekends, more reminders can be sent on these days with a reminder to drink water. 
- Add short exercises for mornings and evenings. 
- A reminder noise or vibration can be sent especially during long periods of no steps taken, or long sedentary minutes, when to wake up, and when to go sleep.
